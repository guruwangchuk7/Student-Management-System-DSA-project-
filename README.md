# Student-Management-System-DSA-project-

Student Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ 
language to manage student records efficiently. The system allows users to add, 
display, search, and sort student information. It is a simple interface for 
managing student databases. This project serves as a basic exercise in 
understanding data structures, algorithms, and basic file control concepts. 

Objectives: 
• To develop a simple console application that allows users to manage 
student records. 
• To implement functionalities for adding, displaying, searching, and 
sorting student data. 
• To enhance programming skills in C++ using structures and control flow.

Input Process 
Main Menu: 
• The user is prompted to choose from the following options: 

Adding a student: 
• Enter Student Name: Input the full name of the student. 
• Enter Gender: Specify the student's gender (options: male, female, 
other). 
• Enter UID: Provide a unique identification number for the student. 
• Enter Class: Input the class of the student. 
• Enter Semester: Specify the current semester of the student. 
• After successful entry, the student is added to the system, and a 
confirmation message is displayed. 

Displaying All Students: 
• The system displays a list of all student records, showing each student’s 
name, gender, UID, class, and semester. 

Finding a Student by UID: 
• Enter UID: Input the UID of the student to search. 
• If a matching UID is found, the student's details are displayed. If not, a 
message indicates that no student was found.

Sorting Students by Name: 
• The system sorts all students alphabetically by name using a simple 
bubble sort algorithm. A confirmation message is displayed once sorting 
is complete.
